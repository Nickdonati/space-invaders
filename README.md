## Game description

> In Alien Invaders, one or two players control a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom of the screen. The players can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys or 'a' and 'd' and shoot bullets using the
spacebar or 'w'. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The players shoot and
destroy the aliens. If the players shoot all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that not only moves faster than the previous fleet, but is also
harder to kill. If any alien hits
the players' ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the players
lose a ship. If the players lose three ships, the game ends.
